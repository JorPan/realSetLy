        <p class="aboutsetly1">
          SetLy is a place for <strong>DJ's and performing Producers</strong> to manage their
          song library and keep track of shows they play to gain valuable insights on
          their performances: 
            <ol>
              <li class="talkingpoints">- What songs they've played and how frequently, </li>
                <li class="talkingpoints">- How many tickets they've sold, </li>
                <li class="talkingpoints">- Build set lists for future shows based
                  on their song library.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="aboutsetly2">
          Concert Goers can create accounts to share setlists with friends, keep track of shows they've attended,
          and get data like how many times they've seen an artist perform their
          favorite song.
